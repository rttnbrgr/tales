### Idea for a music post

I have an idea for this music post. Just wanna compare different music services for my own and the reader's efficacy.

_Services_  

* Pandora
* Spotify
* Rdio
* Beats
* Apple Music
* Others?

### Going-through-pinboard.md

it says i have 146, but i copied them all and it looks like i only have 144. No worries, that problem isnt really worth solving.

i'm gonna go through a couple of the quick ones to see if i can cut this number down. 69 of them, about half are used only once. Let's fix that.

im down to 544 pins and 131 tags
