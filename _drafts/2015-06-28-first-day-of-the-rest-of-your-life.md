title: First Day Of The Rest Of Your Life

I started this post on the day it's listed. But never finished it. It was left with only a title and some filler text. I decided to leave it as the unofficial first post of the blog. 

Fun fact, all my filler text, the FPO stuff comes from [Hipsum][hipsum]. It's just like *lorem ipsum* except with hipster jargon. Pretty fun for what it's worth. There's even a [sketch plugin][plugin] for it. But, for me, it's not been working too well. The plugin that is. 

I'm trying to start writing more. Everybody whose doing what I want to do, tells me I should. I guess I'm gonna start listening for once in my life.

It feels like a muscle that atrophied. But, for a muscle to atrophy it would have had to have been strong at one point. Wow, that was not a well constructed sentence. If that sentence were a dwelling it would not withstand a storm. Not like a hurricane or tornado. Not even a Indiana thunderstorm. It wouldn't stand up to the type of enjoyable spring mist that often provides relief in the muggy months that predate the summer.

No where to go but through.

Enjoy the blog.
