Aesthetic occupy pop-up cray try-hard, food truck pour-over asymmetrical irony quinoa readymade small batch Helvetica.

* [Roderick On The Line][dope-2]  
The best podcast. I'm not debating this with you. Featuring former Long Winter's frontman [John Roderick][jr] and productivity guru [Merlin Mann][mm] all the worlds problems are solved, and *SUPERTRAIN* is coming. Merlin, if you're reading this, that joke was for you.

* [Rick Ross - Sanctified (Emoji)][dope-3]  
I'm not sure exactly how I found this. Probably on [r/HHH][rHHH]. Never was a huge fan of the record itself, but the fan made video, made it enjoyable. Most frustrating Kanye bar: here it is.

* [The Art of Ben Chen][dope-4]  
Spotted on [imgur][imgur] and then further investigated. The style of illustration is right up my alley. The tone and humor are spot on.

* [Art of Album Covers][dope-5]  
You like album covers? Me too. And apparently, so does the person running this here tumblr. A look at the source material for some of your favorite album covers and some you probably never saw before.

* [A Shit Ton of 1970s Logos][dope-10]  
Awesome to look at some old identity work. Remembering that an icon needs to work in contrast. Black and white only. Also a reminder there is nothing new under the sun. If you look close you might spot __NOT__ the AirBnB, Beats, and One-More logo.
