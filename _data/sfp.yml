intro: "Howdy gals and fellas. I want to make cool things with people who care. Instead of updating my resume, I made you a website. Enjoy your scroll, and I look forward to hearing from you soon."

		text: "My name is Nathan. I'm designer by trade who has spent that past half decade teaching myself to code. I now work primarily on front-end development projects for clients and hand-lettering in my free time. I recently moved to Lafayette from Portland, OR and have found very few shops in town doing the kind of work that interests me. I noticed you recently had both a web developer and web graphic designer position open up and subsequently filled. I believe I would have been a strong candidate for either position, I am still DEEPLY interested in joining as an intern.",

		text: "Glad you asked. I'm proficient in all relevant Adobe CS applications (Illustrator, Photoshop, Indesign) as well as communicating layout/mockups in more traditional media (pen, paper, napkin). I'm also great with HTML5, CSS (and SASS), and Javascript (espcially when paired with jQuery). I've used a number of blogging platforms in the past (including Wordpress) but find them to be a bit overkill for most of my clients needs today. While back-end languages are not my primary focus, I have expereince with PHP and a litle bit of Ruby. My last website was built on top of Perch CMS, a handly little backend that is entirely PHP driven. Beyond technical skills, I am a strong communicator, a good teammate, and passionate about the work I do.",

- { headline: "# Part of a team",
		text: "After freelancing for a number of years, I have grown to appreciate all its advantages. The flexibility and autonomy are great, but something's missing. While the interent is a wonderful place to learn and meet talented people, it's not the same as being part of a team. I miss being part of a group of ambitious people working together. The times I spent working with other designers and developers were the most fulfilling of my career. I would like to be a part of that again, and I want to join the team at Stormfront Productions.",

thankYou: "# thank you"
thankYouNote: "Guys and gals of Stormfront Productions, thank you for taking the time to look over my page. Hopefully it demonstrates the skills and desire I can bring to your oustanding team. With my recent move to the area, I am somewhat a fish out of water. I want to find a place to grow as both an individual and part of a community. You can view [my work](http://behance.net/nroth10) or take a gander at some [sketchbook doodles](http://instagram/tayox) if you want to see more. I look forward to hearing from you and joining a team of quality people who build delightful web things. Please contact me via phone or email to discuss moving forward. Enjoy this closing video of my cat and I saying thanks (really hope there's at least one cat person watching this right now)."

- {	question: "But wait, there's more!", 
		text: "Haven't had enough of my engaging wit? Still tryiing to understand why someone would rather build an entire site instead of update the single page of a resume? Not entirely sure why anybody would prefer Pepsi to Coke? Well feel free to enjoy this rather esoteric FAQ section."
}
- { question: 'how did you make this', 
		text: "The same way everybody makes the internets. Pixie dust and unicorn tears! Actually it's built using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. It's using an awesome static site generator called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to manage content. The beautiful cascade of styles are sitting on top of [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) by [Nicholas Galhager](http://nicolasgallagher.com/), [Animate](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) from [Daniel Eden](http://daneden.me/), and the incredibly useful [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) by the good folks over at [ThoughtBot](https://thoughtbot.com/). The animations are thanks to the [WOW.js](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/index.html) library. Fun fact, the only image on the page is the mountains in the hero element up at the top of the page."
}
- { question: 'Are you a designer or a developer?', 
		text: "I consider myself a full stack designer. Or a frontend architect. Or a user experience maven. What's do the cool kids say these days? I like solving problems simply and beautifully. I studied design in school and taught myself how to code to continue solving more interesting and relevant problems. Most days my time is split between the sketchbook-and-CS phase and the Sublime-Text-browser-resize phase."
}
- { question: 'Podcasts or Music',
		text: "Why not both!! Seriously, that's a silly question. I have headphones in my ears roughly 93 and a half percent of my waking hours. It is probably broken up about 60/40 podcast to music these days. If you're new to the podcast world (Yes, there are more than Serial), I would suggest checking out [Marc Maron's WTF](http://www.wtfpod.com/) (though, a bit NSFW at times) and [The Nerdist](http://nerdist.com). If you are already an avid podcast fan, hopefully you are keeping up with [Roderick on the Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/), which is the greatest podcast of all time. For music, I currently use RDIO for most of my music listening needs, though I have a meticulous, metadata rich iTunes library. If you're looking for some awesome new tunes may I suggest FKA Twigs - LP1."

- { question: "You know that's not our logo, right?",
		text: "Yes, I do. But it did show up on your twitter, plus it was fun to tackle making it in pure CSS. If you want to see how I did it, check it out [here](http://codepen.io/tayox/pen/aOqbZR)."
