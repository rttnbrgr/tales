My name is Nathan.

If you want to get in touch to argue about Hip-Hop, put me onto a new podcast, or tell me you found a typo, hit me on [Twitter][0].

Check out my [codes][1] and [pictures][2].

## What Are You Doing Right Now

Listening to a podcast or new album while I fight with my text editor and my cat. 

## Show me your stack

* Built on top of the beautiful work by [@mdo][mdo] and the [Hyde][hyde] theme for [Poole][poole], the butler for [Jekyll][jekyll]). If you are so inclined, you should totally check these things out.
* Stylewise, my preprocessor of choice is [SASS][sass] and this project, like most, is taking advantage of [ThoughtBot's][tb] [Bourbon][bourbon].
* I do my "rough wireframes" on whatever paper is around, lately thats [Rhodia Dot Pads][rhodia] and my [Baron Fig notebook][baron] using blue ball point pens and [Black Wing Pencils][blackwing]
* UI Design is done entirely in [Sketch][sketch], with some specific vector/raster tasks handled in [AI][ai]/[PS][ps] respectively.
* My monospace masticator of choice is [Sublime Text 2][st2] with the [Cobalt 2 Theme][cobalt2] by [Wes Bos][wb]
* Currently hosted on [Hostgator][hg] but will be up on [GitHub pages][ghp] as soon as I straighten out the commits.
