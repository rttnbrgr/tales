## don't read this letter.

no, really, don't read this letter.

i went through a bunch of old boxes with old stuff. there were letters in there you sent me, that i never could throw away. i never wrote you one, so i figure late is better than never.

i don't really know where to start.

## a loopy fiasco

when i went to that lupe show 5 years ago, i was not in a good place. in fact i was in a downright bad, terrible, awful place. i was heartbroken, actively throwing away the hard work of 21 years by trying to drink & smoke myself numb. i only went out of the loyalty i had left for a good friend of mine. i only went out of the loyalty i had left for a good friend of mine.

i went to the show to drink. hear lupe. and see some titties. in that order.

and then i met you. 

## lost in the moment

it's wierd. the weeks, or months, or year(s) of me trying to get you to give a fuck about me are entirely compressed in my mind into a single moment.

i said something about your shoes.

I don't even think i said it directly to you. but you heard me. you looked up. and i saw you smile for the first time.

everything after that, i managed to throw that away some years back. but it feels like i only lost it yesterday.  

[in just a moment.][lost]

it's just hitting me, the beautiful girl that was such a huge part of my life has been MIA. Ur just, a figment of my imagination now. the daydreams are gone. replaced with reality. I actually lost her. lost you. and it took me this long to wake up. 

**what the fuck.**

## Sorry

i know im the asshole who stopped calling.  
the one who wanted to be an artist in LA.  
the one who didn't want to grow up. or have responciblities.
the one who forgot birthdays.  
who called drunk, just to hear a familiar voice and be an asshat.  
[I'm sorry.][sorry]

maybe this is just another letter in the pantheon of boys who didn't get over the girl, and if so, that's fine. I can deal with being a heartsick romantic. I never was as cool as I pretended to be. Not sure if you noticed.

## one day


I always thougth we would circle back to each other in some grand cinematic fasion.  

[one day][1], I was gonna show up. Make a grand gesture. Instead of a ring, I'd have the tattoo pattern for your finger all drawn up. Get your sister and taty to help me plan a surprise party. Just show up, and pick up right where it left off.

But life doesn't work like that.  

Im not too awesome at enjoying the gift of life. the present. I am great at replaying the past. Dissecting it. How I fucked it up. How it could have gone better. Also the future. Imaginary ones where good things happen, and more frequently where a decision I just made leads to some terrible outcome.

im just not a very happy person. don't know why. I've been sober a year now, and that hasn't changed much. I just have to [sit with my emotion][2] now. I'm not that guy with a smile ready to greet the day. But you always put one on my face. I think you always will.  

I know we don't see the world the same, and the stubborn part of me will probably always struggle with that. But the other side *loves* you so much for it. You made me see things I never would have, or even wanted to. I've made no small mention of my fear of getting married. But you, believe it or not, made me reconsider that. You made me, admit, even if only to myself, that being with a great woman would be worth giving up the moral indignation. You made me see how incredible having a child is, which also, *was* and still *is* beyond my scope of understanding. You even got me to stop hating the idea of god and viewing him as a crutch. i was damn near headed back to church! you made me see the best in myself. you never treid to change me. you saw a version of me that I have trouble finding most days. I love you for that. 

## moving on

it's selfish for me to think that a <del>broad</del> girl as beautiful, caring, considerate, fun, and every other nice word in the english language wouldn't meet someone.  

wouldnt fall in love again.  

wouldnt [move on.][ptsd]

it's just selfish. have i established, that im selfish? i think im supposed to say, i just want you to be happy. and the rational part of me does. i hope you find the happiness you deserve. but the other part of me doesn't want to let you go.  

it can't fathom another man with his arm around you. getting to hold you. that part, still thinks about what choices he made to be sleeping here alone. to not see your face, hear ur voice, or share the short, short time we have here.  
i know we don't see those things the same way; i guess it doesnt matter. maybe there is someone up there with a big plan and im just bullshittin myself by not listening for instruction. i've resigned myself to the idea it's all purely coincidental. random. it may seem bleak, but it forces you to give meaning to every moment.

us meeting wasn't fate. neither was me pursuing you. and it damn sure wasn't fate that I ended things like a jackass. we made those things happen. that's the story we wrote.

## broken again

i didn't retain much of the wisdom that my youth pastors gave me. one sermon stuck about love and sex stuck with me. he said  

    your heart is only so big. and every time you love someone, you give a piece of it away. you can't do that forever.

you weren't supposed to get a piece of mine. i had just given so much of myself away, and [I was so broken.][Blow] and am, still. i wish I could have seen just how much you meant to me. Maybe I did and I wouldn't admit it to myself. Those thougts are scary. Or maybe I'm just a chickenshit who needs fauder for his stories and pictures.  

The carpet rides. the old lady on the bench. ur head on my lap as we rode the train. you tolerating my kareoke rap antics. all those things, that were the beginning of a story, won't get the ending i wanted to write; that we wanted to write.  

it's a terribly selfish act to dump all this on you. it's like admitting you cheated. it clears ur consious and dumps all that shit on the person you care about. sorry for that, but i did warn you.  

Tarah, I hope you find happiness. I do. I hope the man lucky enough to catch your heart deserves you.  

For all the stories we won't get to live out together and the pain I've caused you, I'm sorry.  

And when you wake up tomorrow, I hope you forget that some boy spilled his guts to you. It's three in the morning and I'm writing a love letter to a girl I lost.  
My timing is just terrible *charles barkely voice*  

I love you Tarah. I think I always did, and [I always will.][0]
