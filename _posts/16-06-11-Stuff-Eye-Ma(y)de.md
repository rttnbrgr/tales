When you like to make things, you tend to make more stuff than you need. Sometimes it's good enough to share on DRIBBBLE, but a lot of times not. Here is some of the stuff that didn't quite make the cut.

## Code Doodles
![PDX Flag][2]
In May, I spent a few hours I probably should have spent working on updating my resume or doing client work and created the Portland city flag in CSS. I've been doing some CSS illustrations lately and really enjoy bending CSS to my will for no reason other than to make cool things.

## ACQ Toons Updates
![Tasteclub Toons][3]
In the process of updating my portfolio, I revisited some cartoon illustrations I had previously started for my friends at the Acquired Taste Club. Really enjoyed working on these and hopefully they find a purpose beyond twitter avatars. You can see more of them [here][toons-link].

## Tutorials
Also spent some time working through photoshop tutorials in hopes of picking up some new tricks and turning out more graphic eye candy. 

### Duotone
![Duotone Trials][4]
Gradient map + white type = basically every streaming music service graphic. A cool effect and the [tutorial][muzli] is less than 60 seconds.

### Chrome
![ACQ Logo in Chrome][5]
The awesome chrome effect came across my timeline from [@Abduzeedo][ab-twitter]. Abduzeedo produces a punishing amount of quality content in basically any social stream you are a part of... unless you use ello. But you don't. 
You owe it to yourself to check out there site in general, but you can check the [tutorial here][ab-tutorial].

## Badges, Seals, and Banners Oh My
![Two Badges from May][6]
A couple of buddies from my ACQ family were in Portland for a couple days last month. It was incredible to catch up and a good excuse to visit Multnomah falls. The trip produced a bunch of awesome [photos][acq-photos] and a short [beat tape][acq-tape]. I felt like creating a badge was the least I could do. I made a couple other badge-like graphics as well, but the reuinion one was the dopest. 
![Black & White Iteration][7]

Also, making this gif in Photoshop took way too long. The timeline is not my friend.

## Petty Hardaway
![Petty Hardaway][9]
Eye don't even remember exactly why this got made. But pretty safe to bet it was just an image macro response to a twitter comment featuring my former favorite player of all time.

## Wait... why did you do this again?
Because Eye did. Sometimes you gotta make stuff without trying to solve a design problem or meet a business requirement. Making things feels good. Go make more things.
