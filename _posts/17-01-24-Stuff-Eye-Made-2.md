Did you know I used to be a designer? Well, I still identify as a designer, but I don't do much designing. Cue Hank Moody explaining that you're a writer if you write.

My day job involves a lot more javascripting than pen-tool. While I rebuild my portfolio site (and clean my hardrive), I figured I would share some more of my work that probably won't make it out of my design archive. For anybody who missed [Part 1][part1], catch up, we're not gonna wait for you.

### Dope
Not exactly sure of the story behind this one. Pretty sure I hade the dope lettering laying around from an old notebook and never used it for anything. If eye recall, there was some photo reference hoarding of my beautiful Rose City and one of those references made its way into the background of this composition. The typeface was an awesome find from some time before, but it's the first time I used it. It's called [Nickainley][nickainley]

### Graduation Notes
A mutual friend of mine contracted me to create some gradutation cards (of a sort) for her boyfriend (a close friend) and his sister. Does that make sense? Anyways the initial card design ended up morphing into type posters.

They ended up a bit rushed, Definitely tough looking back at the unrefined monoline and my handling of textures, but it's one of the first times I got paid to do hand lettering. Count that as a win and keep it movin.

### Pretty Wings
Maxwell, the singer not the coffee, has a really great record called Pretty Wings. In an ill fated late night attempt to master some dry brush technique I put his BlackSummerNight on repeat and started practicing. The final piece is cobbled together from three sepearte attempts if I remember correctly. Eye picked up a couple new brush pens recently, so hopefully the brush steez will be in full swing for 2017.

### Rocking Chair
My first attempt at the monoline could have gone worse. An old friend of mine put me onto this record and I kind of fell in love with it for a hot minute. Totally played it out for myself, but still a pretty dope record. I recorded my lettering endevour and set it to said tune if you wanna check it out below.

And that concludes part two of *Stuff Eye Made*. Hope you enjoyed yourself, and we'll see you next time. 

PS - I couldn't find Hank Moody on writing, so here's him writing a sad letter/not suicide note to Becca. [Enjoy][moody]
