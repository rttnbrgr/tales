<!-- 1. Why me? -->
# Howdy Folks  
My name is Nathan. I'm designer by trade who has spent the past half decade teaching myself to code. I now work primarily on front-end development projects for clients and hand-lettering in my free time. I recently moved to Lafayette from Portland, OR and have found very few shops in town doing the kind of work that interests me. I noticed you recently had both a web developer and web graphic designer position open up and subsequently filled. I believe I would have been a strong candidate for either position, I am still DEEPLY interested in joining as an intern.

The foundation of design problem solving and an eye for effective aesthetic solutions has helped me work throught this transition.  While printed objects will always hold a place in my heart, the web is where all the action is today. From apps to parallax, the limits of what the blank page can become are endless in this new medium.",

<!-- 2. who -->
# So...You gots any skills?  
Glad you asked. I'm proficient in all relevant Adobe CS applications (Illustrator, Photoshop, Indesign) as well as communicating layout/mockups in more traditional media (pen, paper, napkin). I'm also great with HTML5, CSS (and SASS), and Javascript (espcially when paired with jQuery). I've used a number of blogging platforms in the past (including Wordpress) but find them a bit overkill for most my clients needs today. While back-end languages are not my primary focus, I have expereince with PHP and a litle bit of Ruby. My last website was built on top of Perch CMS, a handly little backend that is entirely PHP driven. Beyond technical skills, I am a strong communicator, a good teammate, proactive, and passionate about the work I do."

<!-- 3. why you -->
# Part of a team  
After freelancing for a number of years, I have grown to appreciate all its advantages. The flexibility and autonomy are great, but something's missing. While the interent is a wonderful place to learn and meet talented people, it's not the same as being part of a team. I miss being part of a group of ambitious people working together. The times I spent working with other designers and developers were the most fulfilling of my career. I would like to be a part of that again, and I want to join the team at Stormfront Productions.

<!-- thanks -->
# thanks you
Guys and gals of Stormfront Productions, thank you for taking the time to look over my page. Hopefully it demonstrates the skills and desire I can bring to your oustanding team. With my recent move to the area, I am somewhat a fish out of water. I want to find a place to grow as both an individual and part of a community. You can view [my work](http://behance.net/nroth10) or take a gander at some [sketchbook doodles](http://instagram/tayox) if you want to see more. I look forward to hearing from you and joining a team of quality people who build delightful web things. Please contact me via phone or email to discuss moving forward. Enjoy this closing video of my cat and I saying thanks (really hope there's at least one cat person watching this right now).

Why you are writing (the opening paragraph)
Why they should be interested in you (the body of the letter)
What action needs to be taken next (the conclusion)

1. How can you fill the employer's need?
This might include the job you're applying for or the role you want to play for the company. If someone your reader knows is referring you for the job, this is a good place to mention that. For example, "So-and-so suggested I apply for the such-and-such job opening in your such-and-such department."

2. What value do you offer the employer? 
Limit this to just two or three of your very best skills, areas of expertise, or other qualifications. This section of the cover letter is where many people go overboard with way too much info. Keep it short. Stick to just the two or three points you have to make. Then move on to the next paragraph. If you want, you can present your points in bullet point statements to make them more inviting to read.

3. What would you like the employer to do next?
You probably want a phone or in-person job interview. The last paragraph is the place to ask for it — along with a polite "Thank you."
