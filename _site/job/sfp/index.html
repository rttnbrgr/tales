			<h1>Howdy Folks</h1>

			<p>My name is Nathan. I&#39;m designer by trade who has spent that past half decade teaching myself to code. I now work primarily on front-end development projects for clients and hand-lettering in my free time. I recently moved to Lafayette from Portland, OR and have found very few shops in town doing the kind of work that interests me. I noticed you recently had both a web developer and web graphic designer position open up and subsequently filled. I believe I would have been a strong candidate for either position, I am still DEEPLY interested in joining as an intern.</p>

			<h1>So...You gots any skills?</h1>

			<p>Glad you asked. I&#39;m proficient in all relevant Adobe CS applications (Illustrator, Photoshop, Indesign) as well as communicating layout/mockups in more traditional media (pen, paper, napkin). I&#39;m also great with HTML5, CSS (and SASS), and Javascript (espcially when paired with jQuery). I&#39;ve used a number of blogging platforms in the past (including Wordpress) but find them to be a bit overkill for most of my clients needs today. While back-end languages are not my primary focus, I have expereince with PHP and a litle bit of Ruby. My last website was built on top of Perch CMS, a handly little backend that is entirely PHP driven. Beyond technical skills, I am a strong communicator, a good teammate, and passionate about the work I do.</p>

			<h1>Part of a team</h1>

			<p>After freelancing for a number of years, I have grown to appreciate all its advantages. The flexibility and autonomy are great, but something&#39;s missing. While the interent is a wonderful place to learn and meet talented people, it&#39;s not the same as being part of a team. I miss being part of a group of ambitious people working together. The times I spent working with other designers and developers were the most fulfilling of my career. I would like to be a part of that again, and I want to join the team at Stormfront Productions.</p>

			<h1>thank you</h1>

			<p>Guys and gals of Stormfront Productions, thank you for taking the time to look over my page. Hopefully it demonstrates the skills and desire I can bring to your oustanding team. With my recent move to the area, I am somewhat a fish out of water. I want to find a place to grow as both an individual and part of a community. You can view <a href="http://behance.net/nroth10">my work</a> or take a gander at some <a href="http://instagram/tayox">sketchbook doodles</a> if you want to see more. I look forward to hearing from you and joining a team of quality people who build delightful web things. Please contact me via phone or email to discuss moving forward. Enjoy this closing video of my cat and I saying thanks (really hope there&#39;s at least one cat person watching this right now).</p>

		<h1>But wait, there's more!</h1>
		<p>Haven&#39;t had enough of my engaging wit? Still tryiing to understand why someone would rather build an entire site instead of update the single page of a resume? Not entirely sure why anybody would prefer Pepsi to Coke? Well feel free to enjoy this rather esoteric FAQ section.</p>

	<article>
		<h1>how did you make this</h1>
		<p>The same way everybody makes the internets. Pixie dust and unicorn tears! Actually it&#39;s built using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. It&#39;s using an awesome static site generator called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to manage content. The beautiful cascade of styles are sitting on top of <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize</a> by <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/">Nicholas Galhager</a>, <a href="http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">Animate</a> from <a href="http://daneden.me/">Daniel Eden</a>, and the incredibly useful <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> by the good folks over at <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/">ThoughtBot</a>. The animations are thanks to the <a href="http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/index.html">WOW.js</a> library. Fun fact, the only image on the page is the mountains in the hero element up at the top of the page.</p>

		<h1>Are you a designer or a developer?</h1>
		<p>I consider myself a full stack designer. Or a frontend architect. Or a user experience maven. What&#39;s do the cool kids say these days? I like solving problems simply and beautifully. I studied design in school and taught myself how to code to continue solving more interesting and relevant problems. Most days my time is split between the sketchbook-and-CS phase and the Sublime-Text-browser-resize phase.</p>

		<h1>Podcasts or Music</h1>
		<p>Why not both!! Seriously, that&#39;s a silly question. I have headphones in my ears roughly 93 and a half percent of my waking hours. It is probably broken up about 60/40 podcast to music these days. If you&#39;re new to the podcast world (Yes, there are more than Serial), I would suggest checking out <a href="http://www.wtfpod.com/">Marc Maron&#39;s WTF</a> (though, a bit NSFW at times) and <a href="http://nerdist.com">The Nerdist</a>. If you are already an avid podcast fan, hopefully you are keeping up with <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/">Roderick on the Line</a>, which is the greatest podcast of all time. For music, I currently use RDIO for most of my music listening needs, though I have a meticulous, metadata rich iTunes library. If you&#39;re looking for some awesome new tunes may I suggest FKA Twigs - LP1.</p>

		<h1>You know that's not our logo, right?</h1>
		<p>Yes, I do. But it did show up on your twitter, plus it was fun to tackle making it in pure CSS. If you want to see how I did it, check it out <a href="http://codepen.io/tayox/pen/aOqbZR">here</a>.</p>
