<p>whisky. i haven&#39;t had too much yet. well, not tonight anyways. i&#39;ve probably drank a lifetime&#39;s worth for a sane, rational human. but what is sane and rational. OOOOOOH real deep thoguht there fuck stick. u broken ass hat. where does a cunt tickler like u get the fucking balls to think he&#39;s worth the fuckin atoms that assemble his being? jesus christ unplug for a fucking minute and contemplate your insignificance. i googled &#39;self destructive behavior&#39; tonight becuase i just wnated to double check i had the nomenclature correct.</p>

<p>my girl won&#39;t acknowledge me. literally i did jumping jacks two feet from her face and she wouldn&#39;t look my way. #noUsher. the bet awards were tonight. I told my friends to send me the links to the cypher. apparently that&#39;s only on the &#39;HIP HOP&#39; awards. I told them i didnt care. one of them said some famous girl showed her tits on a show and they looked like a famous porn star. my other friend googled her, found out she was black and decided he was not interested. life is stupid.</p>

<p>or maybe people are.</p>

<p>actually maybe i am.</p>

<p>i wish all the thoguths i had magically turned into real things. well not all my thgoughts. just the ones that are creataive. constructively creative. </p>

<p>she just went to bed. it&#39;s quiet. well, quieter. </p>

<p>i wish she was screaming. she used to scream. she&#39;s gonna go to sleep, wake up in 7 hours and then be gone until tomrrow night. she&#39;ll come home ask for dinner, try to read an article for work, take a nap, wake up and then go to bed. that&#39;s my life for the next year. im not gonna make it.</p>
